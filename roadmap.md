Okay, here is a proposed blog structure optimized for SEO (targeting Google Saudi Arabia, incorporating modern SEO principles) and a professional prompt for Cursor AI, based on your requirements and folder structure.

Assumptions for SEO (Based on Current Best Practices):

E-E-A-T: Emphasis on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. This means high-quality content, clear authorship, and potentially case studies or testimonials.

Topical Authority: Building comprehensive content hubs around core uniform topics relevant to the Saudi market.

Website language: english

User Intent: Matching content to what users are searching for (information, comparison, purchase intent).

Semantic SEO: Using related terms and concepts, not just exact keywords.

On-Page & Technical SEO: Clean URLs, optimized titles/meta descriptions, headers, internal linking, mobile-friendliness, speed, and schema markup.

Localization: Focusing specifically on the Saudi Arabian context (keywords, regulations, cultural relevance, locations like Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam).

Professional Prompt for Cursor AI (English)
Objective: Generate the foundational code structure (HTML, CSS, potentially basic JS components/placeholders if using a framework like React/Vue/Next.js) for a highly professional, SEO-optimized blog section for a website specializing in corporate and industrial uniforms, specifically targeting the Saudi Arabian market (Google KSA). The goal is to achieve high search engine rankings.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Blog Structure:** Implement the following category structure. Each main category should be a potential pillar page. Create placeholder pages/components for these categories and allow for individual blog post entries within them.
    *   `/blog` (Main listing page)
    *   `/blog/sector-specific-uniforms`
        *   `/blog/aviation-sector`
        *   `/blog/banking-finance-sector`
        *   `/blog/industrial-sector`
        *   `/blog/restaurants-sector`
        *   `/blog/retail-sector`
        *   `/blog/transport-sector`
    *   `/blog/uniform-design-customization`
    *   `/blog/uniform-care-maintenance`
    *   `/blog/buying-guides`
    *   `/blog/industry-insights`
    *   `/author/{author-slug}` (Dynamic route for author profile pages)

2.  **SEO Optimization (Implement placeholders/structure for):**
    *   **URL Structure:** Ensure clean, readable, keyword-rich URLs following the structure above (e.g., `/blog/transport-sector/guide-to-bus-driver-uniforms-ksa`).
    *   **Meta Tags:** Include placeholders for unique `<title>` tags and `<meta name="description">` for each category page and individual blog post page. These should be easily editable.
    *   **Header Tags:** Implement correct heading hierarchy (H1 for the main title of the page/post, H2s for main sections, H3s for sub-sections).
    *   **Image Integration & Alt Text:**
        *   Use the provided image path structure: Category images are in `/public/images/{category_name}/image_file.jpg` (e.g., `/public/images/transport_sector/bus_driver_uniform.jpg`). Author images are in `/public/images/author/author_name.jpg`.
        *   For all images (featured images, inline images), include an `alt` attribute placeholder that should be filled with descriptive text relevant to the image and target keywords (e.g., `alt="Professional Saudi bus driver uniform - [Company Name]"`). Ensure images are responsive.
    *   **Internal Linking:** Structure should facilitate easy internal linking between related posts, and from posts back to their main category page. Include placeholders for "Related Posts" sections on article pages.
    *   **Schema Markup:** Add basic JSON-LD Schema.org placeholders for:
        *   `Blog` or `WebSite` on the main blog page.
        *   `BlogPosting` or `Article` on individual post pages (include placeholders for `headline`, `image`, `author`, `datePublished`, `dateModified`, `description`, `publisher`).
        *   `Person` on the Author pages (include placeholders for `name`, `image`, `description`, `sameAs` [for social profiles]).
    *   **Author E-A-T:** Clearly display Author name on each post, linking to their dedicated author page (`/author/{author-slug}`). The author page should display their bio, expertise, and associated articles. Use images from `/public/images/author/`.

3.  **Content Placeholders:**
    *   For blog post templates, include areas for: Featured Image, Post Title (H1), Author Name & Date, Main Content Body (rich text ready), Categories/Tags, Social Sharing Buttons, Related Posts, Comments Section (optional placeholder).
    *   For category pages, include: Category Title (H1), Category Description, List/Grid of posts within that category with featured image, title, excerpt, and author.

4.  **Design & UX:**
    *   Ensure a clean, professional, and modern design aesthetic.
    *   Mobile-responsive layout is crucial.
    *   Prioritize readability (good font choices, contrast, spacing).
    *   Fast loading speed (optimize image placeholders, clean code).

5.  **Technology:** Generate using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If using a framework context (like React, Vue, Next.js), please generate appropriate components and routing. Assume content will be dynamically populated later.

**Example Image Usage:**
*   When generating a placeholder blog post about Bus Driver Uniforms within the Transport Sector category, use an image path like `/public/images/transport_sector/bus_driver_uniform.jpg` for the featured image or relevant inline image, with an appropriate `alt` text placeholder.
*   When generating an author page template for "Ahmed Khan", use `/public/images/author/ahmed_khan.jpg` (assuming such an image exists).

**Final Goal:** Create a robust, SEO-ready foundation for a blog that can effectively attract and engage businesses in Saudi Arabia looking for uniform solutions, positioning the company as an authority in the field.
