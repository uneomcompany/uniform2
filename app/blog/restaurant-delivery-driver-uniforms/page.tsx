              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Dedicated team integration</strong> – Comprehensive uniform programs for restaurant-employed delivery staff maintaining full brand standards and complete identity alignment through controlled implementation</li>
                <li><strong>Third-party service strategies</strong> – Practical approaches for restaurants utilizing external delivery providers including partial uniform elements, overlay systems, and simplified brand identification components</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid operation frameworks</strong> – Flexible systems accommodating mixed delivery models combining both dedicated staff and supplementary services during peak periods or service expansion phases</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-brand driver accommodation</strong> – Strategic approaches for restaurant groups requiring unified delivery operations across multiple concepts while maintaining appropriate brand differentiation</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                These accommodation strategies address operational diversity—creating appropriate implementation frameworks across Saudi Arabia's varied delivery models rather than single approaches inappropriate for the complex operational landscape with different requirements across restaurant categories.

                <li><strong>Remote staff management</strong> – Effective control systems for delivery personnel operating without constant supervision, including clear standards, verification procedures, and appropriate accountability mechanisms</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-unit standardization</strong> – Consistent implementation approaches for restaurant chains operating across multiple Saudi locations ensuring appropriate brand alignment despite geographic distribution</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability enhancement</strong> – Flexible frameworks supporting rapid capacity adjustments during expansion phases, seasonal fluctuations, and special event periods requiring temporary delivery force increases</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="mb-6">

                <li><strong>Replacement cycle management</strong> – Practical systems acknowledging the accelerated wear patterns of delivery uniforms compared to traditional restaurant attire, including appropriate durability balancing and scheduled replacement protocols</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-function design approaches</strong> – Cost-efficiency enhancements through dual-purpose elements serving both practical safety functions and brand presentation requirements through integrated design solutions</li>
                <li><strong>Variable climate accommodation</strong> – Efficient frameworks addressing Saudi Arabia's seasonal requirements through modular systems rather than complete separate uniforms for different temperature conditions</li>
