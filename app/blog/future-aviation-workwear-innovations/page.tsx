              <p className="mb-6">
                Translating workwear innovations into operational reality requires structured implementation approaches that address the unique considerations of Saudi aviation environments.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Strategic Innovation Assessment</h3>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Evaluation frameworks for identifying highest-value applications:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Role-specific innovation mapping</strong> identifying priority applications by position</li>
                <li><strong>Operational impact evaluation</strong> quantifying potential improvement metrics</li>
                <li><strong>Saudi-specific value assessment</strong> prioritizing locally-relevant innovations</li>
                <li><strong>Technology readiness evaluation</strong> ensuring implementation feasibility</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                These assessment approaches prevent technology-driven implementation without clear operational benefits. Saudi carriers report greatest success when innovation adoption follows structured evaluation identifying specific operational improvements rather than implementing technology for its own sake.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Phased Implementation Strategies</h3>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Structured approaches managing transition complexity:
