              <p className="mb-6">
                The development of banking uniforms in Saudi Arabia reflects the Kingdom's broader economic and social evolution, with distinct phases that mirror the transformation of the financial sector itself.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Foundation Era (1950s-1970s)</h3>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                During the formative period of Saudi Arabia's modern banking system, uniform approaches were characterized by:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Formal Western business attire</strong> for expatriate banking professionals, typically featuring conservative dark suits</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional Saudi dress</strong> for local professionals, creating a dual aesthetic within institutions</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal brand differentiation</strong> through uniform design, with institutional identity primarily conveyed through architectural elements</li>
                <li><strong>Gender homogeneity</strong> in the workforce, with few considerations for female banking attire</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                This initial period established the foundation for banking attire in the Kingdom, emphasizing formality and conservatism as core values expressed through professional presentation.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Expansion and Standardization (1980s-1990s)</h3>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                As the Saudi banking sector experienced significant growth and development, uniform approaches evolved to feature:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Early brand differentiation efforts</strong> through color systems and accessory standardization</li>

                <li><strong>Emergence of hierarchical indicators</strong> through subtle uniform variations</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                This period saw the first systematic approaches to banking uniform design in the Kingdom, with institutions beginning to recognize the strategic importance of staff presentation as a brand element.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Modernization Period (2000s-2015)</h3>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                The early 21st century brought accelerated change to banking uniform approaches, characterized by:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Sophisticated branding integration</strong> through comprehensive uniform programs</li>

              <p className="mb-6">
                During this transformative period, Saudi banks increasingly recognized uniform programs as strategic investments rather than mere operational necessities, developing more sophisticated approaches to staff presentation.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Balancing Tradition and Innovation</h3>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Modern Saudi banking uniforms achieve cultural relevance through:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Gender-Appropriate Design Solutions</h3>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                As female participation in Saudi banking continues to grow, effective uniform programs address gender considerations through:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Culturally respectful design approaches</strong> that maintain professional equivalence</li>
                <li><strong>Accommodating diverse role requirements</strong> across customer-facing and leadership positions</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation to evolving social standards</strong> while maintaining institutional appropriateness</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback-informed development processes</strong> incorporating female banker perspectives</li>

              <p className="mb-6">
                These gender-considerate approaches have transformed from special accommodations to integral components of comprehensive banking uniform strategies in progressive Saudi institutions.
              </p>
              
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Local-Global Balance</h3>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Saudi banks increasingly operate in both national and international contexts, requiring uniform solutions that:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Project global financial sophistication</strong> while maintaining cultural authenticity</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitate cross-cultural customer interactions</strong> through appropriate professional presentation</li>
                <li><strong>Adapt international financial standards</strong> to Saudi contexts</li>

              </ul>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                This balance allows Saudi financial institutions to present themselves as sophisticated global players with authentic cultural foundationsâ€”a powerful combination in both domestic and international operations.
