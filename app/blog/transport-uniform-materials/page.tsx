                When selecting uniforms for your organization, it's essential to consider factors such as 
                durability, comfort, brand alignment, and cultural appropriateness. Each of these elements

              <p className="mb-6">
                Different sectors have unique uniform requirements based on functionality, safety standards, 
                and industry expectations. From healthcare to hospitality, retail to manufacturing, each 
                industry demands specialized attention to detail.

              <p className="mb-6">
                Investing in high-quality uniforms often provides better long-term value despite higher 
                initial costs. Quality uniforms maintain their appearance longer, require less frequent 
                replacement, and contribute to a more professional image.

              <p className="mb-6">
                In Saudi Arabia, uniform designs must respect cultural norms and religious practices while 
                maintaining functionality and professionalism. This includes appropriate coverage, modest 
                designs, and consideration for comfort in the local climate.
