                  width={800}
                  height={450}
                  className="w-full"
                />
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2 text-center">Fire-resistant workwear being tested in laboratory conditions</p>
              </div>

              <h2>High Visibility Elements</h2>
              <p>
                In environments with moving machinery, vehicles, or low-light conditions, high-visibility workwear is essential for worker safety. These garments incorporate fluorescent materials and retro-reflective strips that make workers visible from all angles.
              </p>
              <p>
                High-visibility workwear typically follows international standards such as ANSI/ISEA 107 or EN ISO 20471, with different classes based on the risk level of the work environment. For the most hazardous conditions, Class 3 garments provide the maximum visibility through larger areas of fluorescent material and reflective elements.
              </p>

              <h2>Chemical Resistance</h2>
              <p>
                Workers in petrochemical plants, laboratories, and manufacturing facilities often need protection from hazardous substances. Chemical-resistant workwear is designed to prevent these materials from reaching the skin, where they could cause burns, irritation, or more serious health effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                These specialized garments are often made from synthetic materials like neoprene, nitrile, PVC, or laminated fabrics with barrier properties. The specific resistance depends on the chemicals present in the workplace, making proper material selection crucial for adequate protection.
              </p>
